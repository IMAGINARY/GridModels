# Earth grid models for exhibition use

Geometric grids of the surface of the sphere, as used in Earth sciences.

This repository contains four Grid Models, providing geometric source data (vertices and edges positions), and 3D-printable realizations (adding thickness to the edges and structural consistency).

Their primary use is in the "10-minute museum on the mathematics of climate crisis" by IMAGINARY.

The grid models are the following:
* Latitude and Longitude grid.
* Cubed Sphere grid.
* Hexagonal Icosahedral grid.
* Octahedral Gaussian grid.

On each respective folder you can find source data and 3D-printable final data (stl files).
